# The Banach–Zaretsky theorem (one-dimensional, monotone core)

This file builds the **one-dimensional Banach–Zaretsky theorem** as a reusable measure-theory
fact, from Mathlib's Stieltjes-measure, Radon–Nikodym, and Lebesgue-decomposition machinery.
It is the analytic engine that, on a horizontal slice of a quasiconformal-inverse homeomorphism,
turns "continuous + monotone + Luzin (N)" into the fundamental theorem of calculus
`f b - f a = ∫ₐᵇ f'`.

## Mathematical content

For a **continuous monotone** `f : ℝ → ℝ`, Mathlib associates the **Stieltjes measure**
`μ_f := hf.stieltjesFunction.measure` with `μ_f (Ioc a b) = f b - f a`. Continuity makes it
atomless, so `μ_f (Icc a b) = μ_f (Ioc a b) = f b - f a` as well, and Mathlib shows
(`Monotone.ae_hasDerivAt`) that `f` is a.e. differentiable with
`f' = (rnDeriv μ_f volume).toReal` almost everywhere.

The **Lebesgue decomposition** `μ_f = singularPart + volume.withDensity (rnDeriv μ_f volume)`
yields, on every `Ioc a b`,
`f b - f a = μ_f (Ioc a b) = (singularPart …) (Ioc a b) + ∫_{Ioc a b} f'`.
So the FTC `f b - f a = ∫ₐᵇ f'` holds **iff** the singular part vanishes, i.e. iff `μ_f ≪ volume`.

**Banach–Zaretsky**: condition (N) (`f` carries Lebesgue-null sets to Lebesgue-null sets) makes
`μ_f ≪ volume`. The bridge is the *image* estimate `μ_f A ≤ volume (f '' A)`, valid for a
continuous monotone `f` (the Stieltjes mass of a set is controlled by the Lebesgue measure of its
image — for an interval it is the equality `f b - f a = volume (f '' Icc a b)`). Then condition (N)
gives `volume A = 0 ⟹ volume (f '' A) = 0 ⟹ μ_f A = 0`, i.e. `μ_f ≪ volume`, killing the singular
part.

## Main results

* `StieltjesFunction.measure_Icc_of_continuous` — the atomless mass formula
  `μ_f (Icc a b) = ofReal (f b - f a)` for continuous monotone `f` (PROVEN).
* `stieltjesMeasure_image_Icc` — `μ_f (Icc a b) = volume (f '' Icc a b)` for continuous monotone
  `f` (PROVEN, from `ContinuousOn.image_Icc_of_monotoneOn`).
* `stieltjesMeasure_le_volume_image` — the image estimate `μ_f A ≤ volume (f '' A)` (the genuine
  Banach–Zaretsky inequality; a precisely-stated TRUE residual, see its docstring).
* `monotone_absolutelyContinuous_of_luzinN` — condition (N) ⟹ `μ_f ≪ volume` (PROVEN modulo the
  image estimate).
* `monotone_ftc_of_luzinN` — **the 1D Banach–Zaretsky FTC**: a continuous monotone `f` with
  condition (N) satisfies `f b - f a = ∫ₐᵇ f'` (PROVEN modulo the image estimate, via the Lebesgue
  decomposition + Lebesgue differentiation of the absolutely continuous part).

contributing `μ_f s = volume (f '' s)` (`stieltjesMeasure_image_eq_of_isOpen_ordConnected`). The

/-- **The Banach–Zaretsky image estimate.** For a **continuous monotone** `f`, the Stieltjes mass
of *any* set `A` is bounded by the Lebesgue measure of its image: `μ_f A ≤ volume (f '' A)`.

Proof (the classical descent): by outer regularity of Lebesgue on the target, `volume (f '' A)` is
the infimum over open `V ⊇ f '' A` of `volume V`. For each such `V`, the preimage `f ⁻¹' V` is open
(continuity), contains `A`, and `f '' (f ⁻¹' V) ⊆ V`; the **open-set equality**
`stieltjesMeasure_eq_volume_image_of_isOpen` gives
`μ_f A ≤ μ_f (f ⁻¹' V) ≤ volume (f '' (f ⁻¹' V)) ≤ volume V`. Taking the infimum yields the claim.

This is the genuine Banach–Zaretsky inequality; together with condition (N) it
makes `μ_f ≪ volume` (`monotone_absolutelyContinuous_of_luzinN`). -/

/-! ## The converse direction: a monotone primitive satisfies condition (N) -/

/-- **Condition (N) for a monotone primitive (the converse Banach–Zaretsky direction).** For a
nonnegative function `φ` that is interval integrable on every interval, the primitive
`p x = c + ∫₀ˣ φ` is **continuous monotone** and satisfies **Lusin's condition (N)**: it carries
Lebesgue-null sets to Lebesgue-null sets.

This is the genuine converse of `monotone_absolutelyContinuous_of_luzinN` (which produces
`μ_p ≪ volume` *from* condition (N)); here condition (N) is *produced* from absolute continuity.
The mechanism: the Stieltjes measure of the (absolutely continuous) primitive is exactly the density
measure, `μ_p = volume.withDensity (ofReal φ)` — both are locally finite and agree on every
`Ioc a b` (the FTC `p b - p a = ∫ₐᵇ φ`, with `ofReal (∫ₐᵇ φ) = ∫_{Ioc} ofReal φ`
for `φ ≥ 0`), so they coincide by `Measure.ext_of_Ioc`. As a density measure `μ_p ≪ volume`
(`withDensity_absolutelyContinuous`); combined with the reverse image estimate
`volume (p '' S) ≤ μ_p S` (`volume_image_le_stieltjesMeasure`), a null `S` has null image. -/

Lebesgue-null sets) recovers itself from its a.e. derivative by the fundamental theorem of
calculus: `f b - f a = ∫ₐᵇ deriv f`.

The proof: condition (N) makes the Stieltjes measure `μ_f` absolutely continuous w.r.t. Lebesgue
(`monotone_absolutelyContinuous_of_luzinN`), so the singular part vanishes and the increment is
purely the integral of the density `(rnDeriv μ_f volume).toReal`, which is `deriv f` a.e.
(`Monotone.ae_hasDerivAt`). Quantitatively, `setIntegral_toReal_rnDeriv` gives
`∫_{Ioc a b} (rnDeriv μ_f volume).toReal = μ_f.real (Ioc a b) = (f b - f a)` whenever `a ≤ b`.

/-! ## The bounded-variation Banach–Zaretsky FTC (real-valued)

A continuous function of bounded variation that is a difference `f = p - q` of two **continuous
monotone** functions, each carrying null sets to null sets (condition (N)), satisfies the FTC.
This is the bridge from the monotone case to the general (BV) case, and is the form consumed on a
slice of the quasiconformal inverse: the real and imaginary parts of the slice are continuous BV,
and the genuine 2D area-coupling supplies condition (N) for the monotone pieces. -/

/-- **The bounded-variation Banach–Zaretsky FTC.** If a function `f = p - q` is the difference of
two **continuous monotone** functions `p`, `q : ℝ → ℝ`, each satisfying Lusin's condition (N),
then `f b - f a = ∫ₐᵇ deriv f` whenever `p` and `q` are both a.e. differentiable with
`deriv f = deriv p - deriv q` a.e. (which holds at every point where both `p` and `q` are
differentiable, i.e. almost everywhere).

This is `monotone_ftc_of_luzinN` applied to each monotone piece, recombined by linearity. The
condition-(N) hypotheses on `p` and `q` are exactly what the 2D area-coupling supplies on a slice;
no per-line condition (N) on `f` itself is needed (the decomposition routes it through the monotone
pieces). -/

/-! ## The complex-valued Banach–Zaretsky FTC (the slice form)

For the quasiconformal-inverse keystone the slice `t ↦ g ⟨t, y⟩` is **complex**-valued. Its real
and imaginary parts are continuous of bounded variation; on a.e. slice the 2D area-coupling makes
the monotone pieces of each part satisfy condition (N). This packages the recombination of the two
real `bv_ftc_of_monotone_diff` applications into the complex FTC `s b - s a = ∫ₐᵇ s'` with `s'` the
a.e. complex derivative. -/

/-- **The complex-valued Banach–Zaretsky FTC (slice form).** Let `s : ℝ → ℂ` have real part
`s.re = pr - qr` and imaginary part `s.im = pi - qi`, each a difference of **continuous monotone**
functions satisfying Lusin's condition (N). If `s` has a.e. complex derivative `s' t` (with `s'`
interval integrable), then `s b - s a = ∫ₐᵇ s'`.

The real and imaginary FTCs are `bv_ftc_of_monotone_diff` applied to `s.re` and `s.im`; the a.e.
identities `deriv (s.re) = (s' ·).re`, `deriv (s.im) = (s' ·).im` come from the complex derivative,
and the result is recombined through `Complex.re_add_im`. This is the form consumed on a slice of
the quasiconformal inverse, where the condition-(N) hypotheses on the monotone pieces are the
output of the genuine 2D area-coupling. -/
