# Spherical-metric setup for meromorphic normal families

This file installs `MetricSpace` (and hence `UniformSpace`) instances on the
Riemann sphere `ℂ̂ = OnePoint ℂ` derived from the spherical (chordal) metric
defined in `Sphere/SphericalMetric.lean`. The induced topology coincides with
the one already on `OnePoint ℂ` by `sphericalDist_induces_topology`.

With these instances in place, `IsNormal 𝓕 U` from `NormalFamilies/Basic.lean`
specializes to the meromorphic case (`Y = ℂ̂`) — sequences in a family of
meromorphic functions `ℂ → ℂ̂` having locally-uniformly-convergent
subsequences with respect to the spherical metric.
