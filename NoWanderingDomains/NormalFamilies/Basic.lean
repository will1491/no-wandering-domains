# Normal families

A family `𝓕` of functions `X → Y` is *normal* on a set `U ⊆ X` if every
sequence in `𝓕` has a subsequence converging locally uniformly on `U` (to
some limit `g : X → Y`). The domain `X` is a topological space and the
target `Y` a uniform space. The classical case has `X = ℂ` and `Y = ℂ`;
the spherical case has `Y = ℂ̂`; the dynamics of rational maps uses
`X = Y = ℂ̂`.

`IsNormalAt 𝓕 z` localizes the notion to a neighborhood of a point; it is
the membership predicate defining the Fatou set.

This file gives the abstract definitions and their monotonicity/transfer
lemmas; `Montel.lean` contains the classical Montel theorem (locally
uniformly bounded ⇒ normal).
