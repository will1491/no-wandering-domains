# An essential grid loop from a bounded complementary component

An open set with a bounded complementary component carries a grid loop with
nonzero winding number about a point of that component.

-- This essential-loop separation proof elaborates as one large declaration whose
-- nested winding / complementary-component `have` chains exceed the default budget.
/-- **Essential loops around separated compact complementary pieces.** If a
compact piece `A` of the closed complement of an open set `T` is metrically
separated from the rest of the complement, then some closed curve in `T`
has nonzero winding number about any prescribed point of `A`: the boundary
of the union of small grid squares meeting `A` consists of grid edges lying
in `T`, and by the per-edge principal-logarithm increment linearity the
total winding of its boundary cycles about the point is one, so some cycle
is essential. -/
