# Winding numbers of loops in the plane

The winding number of a closed continuous curve `γ : C(I, ℂ)` about a point
`q` not on the curve, defined through continuous logarithm lifts: any lift
`L` with `exp (L t) = γ t − q` changes by `2πi · m` over the interval for a
unique integer `m`, the winding number.

Lifts exist by factoring `γ − q` as modulus times unimodular part and lifting
the unimodular part through the circle covering `Circle.exp`; the increment
is lift-independent because two lifts differ by a continuous `2πiℤ`-valued
function on the connected interval, hence a constant.

The file provides the calculus consumed by the grid-homotopy development and
the covering-degree dichotomy: multiplicativity (windings add over pointwise
products), concatenation additivity, vanishing on balls, constancy on
connected sets avoiding the curve, homotopy invariance, and the polynomial
argument principle in winding form (the winding of `p ∘ γ` about `0` is the
root-multiset sum of windings of `γ` about the roots).
